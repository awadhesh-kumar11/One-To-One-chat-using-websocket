# One-To-One-chat-using-websocket

Using this we can establish a websocket connection with the participants and could chat with any one connected one to one.
Chat history is not stored in any database it gets destroyed after you disconnect and will start fresh.

To send the message we need to follow pattern like message/to

messsage could be replaced by your message and to by the id to whom you want message to send.
